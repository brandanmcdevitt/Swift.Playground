### My Journey Through Swift

This is where I will keep all of my Swift source code that I have written for solutions to online courses, challenges and exercises. Everything I have written in the Swift language - <i>except project related code</i> - will be stored here. I will try to maintain and update code files as I become more experienced in Swift.
